# Upgrading to version 1.x.x

Version 1.0.0 has some breaking changes with regard to consuming the event stream. The new functionality is described [here](./README.md#consume-messages).
In the samples project you can find an [example](../number-portability-sdk-samples/test/NumberPortabilityMessageConsumerTest.php) of how the new `NumberPortabilityMessageConsumer` can be used.
